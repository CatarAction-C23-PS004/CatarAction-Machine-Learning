# CatarAction

## About the Project

Cataracts are a common eye disease, typically progresses slowly and leads to visual disturbances, including blurred vision, which can eventually cause blindness if left untreated. According to the Rapid Assessment of Avoidable Blindness (RAAB) survey conducted by the Indonesian Ophthalmologist Association and Balitbangkes, cataracts account for 81 percent of all cases of blindness in Indonesia, with a national blindness rate of 3 percent. There are only 3,000 ophthalmologists spread across the country, making early treatment. 

Our team identified the prevalence of health issues, particularly eye diseases like cataracts, in our country that often go undetected until it's too late. We recognized the potential for technology to help in this area and decided to develop an accessible mobile application that can detect cataracts and provide guidance to those suffering from the condition. The app will be an easy-to-use tool that can help people identify cataracts at an early stage and get the necessary treatment.

## Made With

1. Google Colab
2. TensorFlow

### Dataset Source
[Cataract Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nandanp6/cataract-image-dataset)

## Steps

1. Search for datasets and import them into Google Colab.
2. Perform data preprocessing by splitting the data into three subsets: train, validation, and test.
3. Apply data augmentation using ImageDataGenerator.
4. Build a model using TensorFlow MobileNet and check the loss and accuracy on the train and validation sets.
5. Evaluate the model on the test set.
6. Export the model in tflite and .h5 formats for further processing by the Mobile Development and Cloud Computing team.
